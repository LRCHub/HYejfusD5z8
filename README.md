[00:14.76] Everything was easy
[00:16.61] I did it all alone so effortlessly
[00:20.16] I spread my wings
[00:21.08] And let my magic unfold
[00:23.36] Got all problems solved
[00:25.15] Without any setbacks
[00:26.43] There is nothing uncontrolled
[00:40.93] 
[00:28.84] But there's no way I can begin
[00:30.50] Dream life that I need to win
[00:32.38] I need to feel how all these things
[00:33.84] Crumble into little pieces
[00:35.69] I know I gotta soar a little higher
[00:39.03] Hope all turns to be the things I desire
[00:59.03] 
[00:42.78] Layaknya burung merak yang bersayap
[00:46.01] Kan kutaklukkan gelap
[00:48.56] Dengan sihir angin kan kuajak semua yg terlelap
[00:52.35] 'Tuk bangkit melawan dunia, we'll never give up!
[01:16.35] 
[00:56.46] As long as we got the strength in ourselves
[00:59.92] We could rise above the pain
[01:02.15] We're stronger than them
[01:03.33] Walking step by step
[01:05.12] Trusting my own pace
[01:06.94] Giving me what I deserve to have
[01:09.10] (Let's go) Just believe me
[01:22.10] 
[01:10.80] (Let it go) They'll never bring me down
[01:13.21] Just believe me
[01:14.32] (Let it go) It'll never bring us down
[01:16.74] Just believe me
[01:17.39] Won't let their cruelty stealing my royalty
[01:20.89] And when the universe works against me
[01:23.07] I will just
[01:28.57] 
[01:23.85] (Let it go) If it's spicy
[01:25.50] Just sip some tea, let it go
[01:27.53] (Let it go) If it's spicy
[01:29.04] Just sip some tea, let it go
[01:31.86] (Let it go) If it's spicy
[01:32.59] Just sip some tea, let it go
[01:34.28] Let it go
[01:38.78] 
[01:38.10] I've been livin' carefree
[01:40.19] There's no bitter words in the world
[01:41.96] That could affect me
[01:43.64] I spread my wings and let my magic unfold
[01:46.99] Not letting it show
[01:48.49] Stings but I'm bigger than my feelings
[01:50.63] So that'll be enough
[02:00.63] 
[01:52.30] There is no way I can begin
[01:54.06] Dream life that I need to win
[01:55.89] I need to feel how all these things
[01:57.37] Crumble into little pieces
[01:59.19] I know I gotta be better than ever
[02:02.54] Hope all turns to be sweeter than ever
[02:21.54] 
[02:06.20] Layaknya burung merak yang bersayap
[02:09.42] Kan kutaklukkan gelap
[02:10.39] Dengan sihir angin kan kuajak semua yg terlelap
[02:14.41] 'Tuk bangkit melawan dunia, we'll never give up!
[02:38.41] 
[02:19.93] As long as we got the strength in ourselves
[02:23.30] We could rise above the pain
[02:25.63] We're stronger than them
[02:26.85] Walking step by step, trusting my own pace
[02:30.30] Giving me what I deserve to have
[02:46.30] 
[02:32.63] (Let's go) Just believe me
[02:34.32] (Let it go) They'll never bring me down
[02:36.65] Just believe me
[02:37.82] (Let it go) It'll never bring us down
[02:40.17] Just believe me
[02:40.80] Won't let their cruelty stealing my royalty
[02:44.39] And when the universe works against me
[02:46.55] I will just
[02:52.05] 
[02:47.38] Let it go
[02:50.79] Let it go
[02:57.75] Let it go
